I am an associate professor at the School of Software, Northwestern Polytechnical University, and a member of the National Engineering Laboratory for Integrated Big Data Application Technologies in Air, Space, Earth, and Sea, holds a Ph.D. in Computer Application Technology from Harbin Institute of Technology. My achievements include being listed among the top 2% scientists worldwide in 2022/2023, recognized as a provincial-level talent, a municipal-level talent, and a Soaring Star at Northwestern Polytechnical University. I have also received numerous accolades, such as the 2022 Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award from the Provincial Artificial Intelligence Society, the 2021 Shenzhen CCF Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, the 2022 Harbin Institute of Technology Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, a special invitation for the Huawei Global Genius Program Interview in 2021, and recognition as an outstanding undergraduate thesis supervisor at Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2022/2023.As the first Ph.D. graduate (ahead of schedule) from the Computing Department across the three campuses of Harbin Institute of Technology in 2017, I graduated from the Shenzhen campus, having received the National Scholarship and the Provincial Merit Student Award at every stage of my undergraduate, master's, and doctoral studies (four times for the National Scholarship and three times for the Heilongjiang Provincial Merit Student Award). I was also named an Outstanding Student, an Outstanding Graduate, and a recipient of the Harbin Institute of Technology's Research Role Model.My research interests lie in video/image restoration and recognition, image generation, and deep learning. I have published over 70 papers in prestigious international journals and conferences such as IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TMM, IEEE TSMC, IEEE TGRS, IEEE TCSVT, IEEE TIV, Pattern Recognition, Neural Networks, Information Sciences, Information Fusion, and ICASSP. Among these, six are ESI highly cited papers, three are ESI hot papers, four are cover papers in top journals, and five are included in the Benchmark List of the international super-resolution field. Notably, the technology described in one of my papers has been purchased for commercial use by an American medical imaging company, and the technology in another paper has been applied to Apple phones by Japanese engineers.Furthermore, I serve as an editorial board member for several SCI journals, including CAAI Transaction on Intelligence Technology and Dense Technology. I am also a reviewer for the National Natural Science Foundation of China, a technology expert in Shanghai, a digital economy development expert in Qingyang, Gansu, a network and information expert in Suzhou, a council member of the Suzhou Artificial Intelligence Society, and an expert in the National Graduate Education Evaluation and Monitoring Expert Database.
